All exercises from Structured Programming lesson (icsd3354) in C @ICSD of Aegean University 2015.

##1
###1-1
sum of x^2 where x is ints from 1 to 100 and prints per 20 numbers.

###1-2
little game of 2 players trying to find or make the nearest possible guess of a random number

###1-3
small app for 6 judges grading 20 singers and choosing to promote them or not

###1-4
Find punctuation errors (open parentheses or guillemets or closed ones without being needed)

##2
###2-1
Make magic squares from odd numbers

###2-2
A little game where you have to find 20 treasures over a 23x79 matrix (including the wall), you move around by inserting a number and hitting enter (keypad in mind)

###2-3
A 2 player game where you have to make a row or a column or a diagonal of 5, the file with 'a' in the end is the 2 player game and the file with 'b' in the end is made with an option menu so you can choose to play with another player or with cpu. I think that it's impossible to win the cpu or another player if we are talking about a sane man.

##3
###3-1
You write 20 words and tells you the times a letter is being found. Even if it was the first pointer program we had to write, it wasn't that hard. p.s. you are not that obliged to hit enter after every word, space is fine to get over with it.

###3-2
Simple "Guess the word" pointer-use implementation.

###3-3
We re-wrote 4 basic string library functions to see how they work and exercise pointers.
